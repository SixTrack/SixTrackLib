step 1:
  build memory for cl track
ster 2:
  track fodo
step 3:
  remake SixTrack benchmark using sixtrack tools


Big Picture:

sixtracklib in C:
  track (CParticle, CBlock, blocks or blockid
        elembyelem *
        turnbyturn *)

sixtracklib in python:
  python objects helper class to interact with CBuffers


pysixtrack:
Element:
  validate attributes
  track with the attributes anything Particles-like
  generate CObject
  track using sixtracklib a CParticles

Particles:
  collection of specific coordinates
  generate a CObject
